Using RDF, SPARQL and Wikidata Query Service, implement a movie recommendation system that collects data from IMDb.

Also, create a knowledge graph, which will be filled with a given CSV file (many values of which are missing) and with Wikidata queries (to fill the missing values).

Then, use the graph to recommend the proper movies, test the precision and show results.
