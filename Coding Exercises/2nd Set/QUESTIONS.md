Based on the knowledge graph of the first exercise, the goal is to create a syntactically correct ontology.

I first transform said ontology to OWL by defining new concepts, such as directors, actors, duration etc. and then define roles for each property.

Lastly, by using Protégé I am enriching my ontology as much as possible.
